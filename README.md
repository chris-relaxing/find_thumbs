# find_thumbs
Point this script at a folder that has zip files and it will search each zip file for Thumbs.db files. If Thumbs.db files are found, a find_thumbs.txt file will be created in the searched folder and it will contain the counts and locations of Thumbs.db files that were found inside each zip. If no Thumbs.db files are found, then no output file will be created.
